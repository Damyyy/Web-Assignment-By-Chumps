                    The history of Penang was shaped by British colonialism, beginning with the acquistion of Penang Island from the Sultan of Kedah by the British East India Company in 1786. Penang was founded by Sir Francis Light because he was instructed by the British East India Company to establish trade relations in the Malay Peninsula. Penang is a strategic location in the Malacca Straits as it would serve as a "convenient magazine for trade". The capital state of Penang is called George Town. After getting Penang, Penang was governed as part of the Straits Settlements together with Malacca and Singapore. During World War 2, Penang was under the Japanese occupation from 19 December 1941 - 3 September 1945. Under the Japanese occupation, many lives were lost due to food shortages and killed by Japanese soldiers. The Japanese targeted mainly Chinese people living in Penang due to the scornful views between the Japanese and Chinese people. When World War 2 ended, George Town was the first city to be liberated by the British.
